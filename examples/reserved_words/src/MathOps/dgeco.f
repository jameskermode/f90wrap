c     on return
c
c        a       an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers
c                which were used to obtain it.
c                the factorization can be written  a = l*u  where
c                l  is a product of permutation and unit lower
c                triangular matrices and  u  is upper triangular.
c
c        ipvt    integer(n)
c                an integer vector of pivot indices.
c
c        rcond   double precision
c                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  a .
c                for the system  a*x = b , relative perturbations
c                in  a  and  b  of size  epsilon  may cause
c                relative perturbations in  x  of size  epsilon/rcond .
c                if  rcond  is so small that the logical expression
c                           1.0 + rcond .eq. 1.0
c                is true, then  a  may be singular to working
c                precision.  in particular,  rcond  is zero  if
c                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
c                underflows.
c
c        z       double precision(n)
c                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
c                if  a  is close to a singular matrix, then  z  is
c                an approximate null vector in the sense that
c                norm(a*z) = rcond*norm(a)*norm(z) .
