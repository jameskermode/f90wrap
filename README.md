f90wrap: Fortran to Python interface generator with derived type support
========================================================================

![Build Status](https://github.com/jameskermode/f90wrap/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)

f90wrap is a tool to automatically generate Python extension modules
which interface to Fortran code that makes use of derived types. It
builds on the capabilities of the popular
[f2py](https://sysbio.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/) utility by generating a
simpler Fortran 90 interface to the original Fortran code which is then
suitable for wrapping with f2py, together with a higher-level Pythonic
wrapper that makes the existance of an additional layer transparent to
the final user.

Dependencies
------------

 1.  [Python](http://www.python.org) 3.6+ (Python 2.7 no longer supported)
 2.  Recent version of [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) which includes `f2py`
 3.  Fortran compiler - tested with `gfortran` 4.6+ and recent `ifort` 12+

Installation
------------

For the latest stable release, install with `pip`:

```
pip install f90wrap
```

There is also a [conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/f90wrap) on conda-forge:

```
conda install -c conda-forge f90wrap
```

For the development version, installation is as follows:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/jameskermode/f90wrap
```

Note that if your Fortran 90 compiler has a non-standard name
(e.g. gfortran-9) then you need to set the `F90` environment variable
prior to installing f90wrap to ensure it uses the correct one, e.g.

```
F90=gfortran-9 pip install f90wrap
```

Examples and Testing
--------------------

To test the installation, run `make test` from the `examples/`
directory. You may find the code in the various examples useful.

Case studies
------------

f90wrap has been used to wrap the following large-scale scientific
applications:

 - [QUIP](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/) - molecular dynamics code
 - [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org) - electronic structure code

See this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jameskermode/f90wrap/blob/master/docs/tutorials/f90wrap-demo-feb-2020.ipynb) 
from a recent seminar for more details.

Usage
-----

To use `f90wrap` to wrap a set of Fortran 90 source files and produce
wrappers suitable for input to f2py use:

    f90wrap -m MODULE F90_FILES

where `MODULE` is the name of the Python module you want to produce (e.g.
the name of the Fortran code you are wrapping) and `F90_FILES` is a list
of Fortran 90 source files containing the modules, types and subroutines
you would like to expose via Python.

This will produce two types of output: Fortran 90 wrapper files suitable
for input to `f2py` to produce a low-level Python extension module, and a
high-level Python module desinged to be used together with the
f2py-generated module to give a more Pythonic interface.

One Fortran 90 wrapper file is written for each source file, named
`f90wrap_F90_FILE.f90`, plus possibly an extra file named
`f90wrap_toplevel.f90` if there are any subroutines or functions defined
outside of modules in `F90_FILES`.

To use f2py to compile these wrappers into an extension module, use:

    f2py -c -m _MODULE OBJ_FILES f90wrap_*.f90 *.o

where `_MODULE` is the name of the low-level extension module.

Optionally, you can replace `f2py` with `f2py-f90wrap`, which is a
slightly modified version of `f2py` included in this distribution
that introduces the following features:

1.  Allow the Fortran `present()` intrinsic function to work correctly with
    optional arguments. If an argument to an f2py wrapped function is
    optional and is not given, replace it with `NULL`.
2.  Allow Fortran routines to raise a RuntimeError exception with a
    message by calling an external function `f90wrap_abort`().
    This is implemented using a `setjmp()/longjmp()` trap.
3.  Allow Fortran routines to be interrupted with `Ctrl+C` by installing
    a custom interrupt handler before the call into Fortran is made.
    After the Fortran routine returns, the previous interrupt handler
    is restored.

Notes
-----

- Unlike standard `f2py`, `f90wrap` converts all `intent(out)` arrays to
`intent(in, out)`. This was a deliberate design decision to allow allocatable and automatic arrays of unknown output size to be used. It is hard in general to work out what size array needs to be allocated, so relying on the the user to pre-allocate from Python is the safest solution.
- Scalar arguments without `intent` are treated as `intent(in)` by `f2py`. To have `inout` scalars, you need to call `f90wrap` with the `--default-to-inout` flag and declare the python variables as 1-length numpy arrays (`numpy.zeros(1)` for example).
- Pointer arguments are not supported.
- Arrays of derived types are currently not fully supported: a workaround is provided for 1D-fixed-length arrays, i.e. `type(a), dimension(b) :: c`. In this case, the super-type `Type_a_Xb_Array` will be created, and the array of types can be accessed through `c.items`. Note that dimension b can not be `:`, but can be a parameter.


How f90wrap works
-----------------

There are five steps in the process of wrapping a Fortran 90 routine to
allow it to be called from Python.

1.  The Fortran source files are scanned, building up an
    abstract symbol tree (AST) which describes all the modules, types,
    subroutines and functions found.
2.  The AST is transformed to remove nodes which
    should not be wrapped (e.g. private symbols in modules, routines
    with arguments of a derived type not defined in the project, etc.)
3.  The `f90wrap.f90wrapgen.F90WrapperGenerator` class is used to write
    a simplified Fortran 90 prototype for each routine, with derived
    type arguments replaced by integer arrays containing a
    representation of a pointer to the derived type, in the manner
    described in
    [Pletzer2008](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2008.94).
    This allows opaque references to the
    true Fortran derived type data structures to be passed back and
    forth between Python and Fortran.
4.  f2py is used to combine the F90 wrappers and the original compiled
    functions into a Python extension module (optionally, f2py can be
    replaced by f2py-f90wrap, a slightly modified version which adds
    support for exception handling and interruption during exceution of
    Fortran code).
5.  The `f90wrap.pywrapgen.PythonWrapperGenerator` class is used to
    write a thin object-oriented layer on top of the f2py generated
    wrapper functions which handles conversion between Python object
    instances and Fortran derived-type variables, converting arguments
    back and forth automatically.
